Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
 Expected Output:
The output should include the result of each operation performed, for example:
"""

"""
num1 = input("Enter the first number ")
num2 = input("Enter the second number")
result_add = int(num1) + int(num2)
print("Addition:", result_add)
result_sub = int(num1) - int(num2)
print("Subtraction:", result_sub)
result_mul = int(num1) * int(num2)
print("Multiplication:", result_mul)
result_div = int(num1) / int(num2)
print("Division:", result_div)

Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.
Expected Output:
The program should output a greeting like:
 
"""

"""

first_name = input("Enter your first name")
last_name = input("Enter your last name")
full_name = first_name+last_name
print("Hello!", full_name + "!", "Welcome to the Python program")
